To login to Midway using an internet browser:
https://midway-login1.rcc.uchicago.edu/main/

-hint: Firefox is recommended over Chrome if you are using a touch-screen enabled device
	-Chrome apparently has a known compatibility bug with Thinlinc, in which touch-screen users
	are restricted to ONLY using touch and not a regular mouse

In Terminal (don't type quotes):
"quota" => show current data storage, quota, hard limits, and grace period 
"accounts balance" => show processing units allocation, usage, and balance
"sbatch <batch_script>" => submit a batch 
"squeue --user=<username>" => show status of any batches
"module avail <software_name>" => check if software is available (e.g., "module avail ANTs")
"module load <software_name>" => load software (although you need to assure that ANTs is available on your Midway, you do not need to load it; a command to load it is contained in the sbatch script)
